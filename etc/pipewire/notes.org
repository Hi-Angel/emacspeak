* Background

About a year ago I switched from using raw ALSA to pulseaudio.
Linux on my laptop just cut over to using pipewire with pipewire-pulse
providing a compatibility drop-in.
However that drop-in does not automatically provide all my pulse
customizations --- see [[../pulse/readme.org][pulse readme]] for details.
These notes document what broke and how I fix them.

* Out-Of-The-Box Breakages

  - No left or right TTS devices.
  - Auditory Icons go back to using aplay rather than paplay with
    samples loaded
  - X-Windows bell went away ---
  - Volume manipulation via pactl went away
  - Volume in emacspeak minor mode line went away
  - Recording in AsTeR will need to be reimplemented.
  - ToDo: Implement all customizations from default.pa in native pipewire.
