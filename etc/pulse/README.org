* Introduction 

This is on my Thinkpad X1 Carbon V9. 
Things may be different on other laptops and soundcards.

* Pulseaudio Configuration 

I have these files in ~/.config/pulse on my new laptop.
* default.pa

** Use BS2B Sink As Default

This is optimized for headphone listening.

  1. Create a bs2b sink
  2. Make that sink the default sink for all clients

** Sinks For Emacspeak Notifications 

emacspeak sends speech notifications to the right ear by default.
Enable this by creating devices ~tts_left~ and  ~tts_right~.


* Issues And Workarounds

** Speaker Vs Headphone 

  1.   Unplugging headphones  leaves speaker muted and
     vice-versa. After plugging/unplugging headphones, press _C-e ( C-j_
     in emacspeak if necessary. See asound.state here for my
     sound-card; I place it in _~/.emacs.d~ for emacspeak to find it.
