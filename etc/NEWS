   Soundscapes updated and tuned for better headphone listening.
   
**  Updated Auditory Icons

   Theme ~pan-chimes~ updated for better headphone listening.

   Transient support has been updated to avoid chatter. With the
   newest version of transient, emacspeak users can navigate
   transients by sections.

   Module ~emacspeak-calibredb~ speech-enables ~calibredb~, a

** Removed Tapestry Dependency

Emacspeak no longer depends on tapestry.el  which was cloned from the

Key _C-e M-t_ now runs an equivalent command that does not depend on tapestry.

** Incorporate Awesome RSS

   See _etc/awesome-rsss-fixup.sh_ for setup instructions; this
   enables discovery of RSS feeds via a collection of updated ~OPML~
   files from the _awesome-rss_ project on Github.
