* Pipewire setup

This is the Pipewire customization on my laptop.
I have this directory symlinked in ~/.config

1. To have changes made here take effect, run:
:pipewire -c filter.conf &
2. If it works, restart the pipewire service:
:  systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse
1. You'll likely need to restart Emacs
2. If things break and you lose audio, remove the symlink and
      restart the pipewire and pipewire-pulse service as above.
