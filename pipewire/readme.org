* Pipewire setup

This is the Pipewire customization on my laptop.
I have this directory symlinked in ~/.config

1. To have changes made here take effect, run:
: systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse
2. You'll likely need to restart Emacs
3. If things break and you lose audio, remove the symlink and
      restart the pipewire and pipewire-pulse service as above.
