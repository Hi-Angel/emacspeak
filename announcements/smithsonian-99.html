<H1>Short Summary</H1>
  Emacspeak is a speech interface that allows blind and
  visually impaired users to interact independently and
  efficiently with the computer.  Available free of cost on
  the Internet, Emacspeak has dramatically changed how the
  author and hundreds of blind and visually impaired users
  around the world interact with the personal computer and
  the Internet.

1.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits</H2>

<p>
Emacspeak provides complete eyes-free access to daily
computing tasks.  By providing fluent spoken access to
local and remote electronic information, the system
opens up the wealth of information available on the
Internet to visually impaired users.

<p>
Emacspeak introduces several improvements and innovations
when compared with <em>screenreaders</em> designed to allow
blind users to interact with personal computers.  Unlike
screenreaders that speak the contents of a visual display,
Emacspeak speaks the underlying information.  As an example,
using a calendar application with a screenreader results in
the blind user hearing a sequence of meaningless numbers; In
contrast, Emacspeak speaks the relevant date in an easy to
comprehend manner -see Figure <A href="#fig:calendar">1.1</A>.

    that makes it easy to see the underlying structure. The calendar
    display consists of a set of characters on the screen; but the
    meaning of this display is as much in its visual layout as in the
    characters themselves. Merely speaking the text
     fails to convey meaning.
     We can see that January&nbsp;1, 2000 is a Saturday;
    this information is missing when the visual display is spoken.</center>

<p>
<p>
The system deploys the innovative technique of audio
formatting to increase the band-width of aural
communication; changes in voice characteristic and
inflection combined with appropriate use of non-speech
auditory icons are used throughout the user interface to
create the equivalent of spatial layout, fonts, and
graphical icons so important in the visual interface.  This
provides rich contextual feedback and shifts some of the
burden of listening from the cognitive to the perceptual
domain.

<p>
Finally, Emacspeak is completely free; in contrast,
commercially available screenreaders typically double the
cost of a personal computer.  These innovations have
together resulted in the system significantly increasing the
ability of visually impaired individuals throughout the
world to more effectively use information technology for
work and leisure.  As demonstrated by the user feedback
included in this case study, this has resulted in visually
impaired individuals throughout the world obtaining access
to higher education as well as gainful employment in the
high technology field.

</OL>
<p>

<H3>Long-term Benefits To Society</H3>

<p>
History has repeatedly shown that technologies first
invented to serve individuals with special needs
eventually prove beneficial to all of mainstream
society. The technological innovations introduced by
Emacspeak are likely to once again bear this out.

<p>
Initially designed to provide efficient information
access to visually impaired users, these same
technological innovations will play a pivotal role in
enabling ubiquitous information access for mainstream
society, <em>e.g.</em>,&nbsp;accessing the wealth of information on
the Internet via a mobile telephone or whilst driving.

<p>

<H3>A Revolutionary Change</H3>

<p>
Emacspeak drastically changes how daily computing tasks
are performed in an eyes-free environment.  Earlier
technologies forced the individual to listen to and
interpret the meaning of visually presented
information; this placed a significant cognitive burden
on the  user.  Emacspeak, on the other hand,
treats speech interaction as a first-class modality in
the human-computer interface.  This allows the user to
focus on the task at hand, as opposed to repeatedly
asking questions of the form:

<p>

<blockquote>Where is the computer cursor now?
</blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote>Where is the mouse pointer now?
</blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote>What is the significance of this button?
</blockquote>
<p>

<H3>Impact On Mainstream Society</H3>

<p>
Emacspeak has laid the groundwork for developing
full-fledged conversational interfaces suitable for
deployment in personal information appliances such as
automobile computers, palm-sized computers and mobile
telephones.  The Emacspeak environment can already be
used on a pocket-sized hand-held computer.  As these
technologies move out into the mainstream market, they
will have a profound impact on how we work and play in
the coming millennium.

<p>
        <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc1.2">
1.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Relevance Of Information Technology</H2>

<p>
Emacspeak takes advantage of the hundreds of man years
of research and development invested in the field of
text to speech conversion.  Text to speech technology
forms the basis of providing eyes-free information
access.  Emacspeak also benefits significantly from the
wealth of information available on the Internet.  We
live in an age where almost all information manifests
itself as electronic bits at some point in its
lifetime; this makes it possible for Emacspeak to level
the playing field with respect to information access
where visually impaired users are concerned.

<H3>Technological Innovations</H3>

<p>
 
<OL type="1">
<li> <b>Audio Formatting</b>

<p>
   This technique is analogous to the well-understood
   notion of visual formatting. Spoken information is
   overlaid with changes in voice characteristic and
   inflection and combined with non-speech auditory
   icons to produce rich aural presentations that
   significantly enhance the band-width of aural
   communication, thereby shifting  some of the burden
   of listening from the cognitive to the perceptual domain.

<p>

<li> <b>Speech-enabling Applications</b>

<p>
   This technique involves building speech interaction
 <em>directly</em> into the user application, as opposed to
building a separate application that speaks the visual
display. Speech-enabled applications are easier and
more productively used in an eyes-free environment,
since such applications take full advantage of the
available features of an auditory display.  
</OL>
<p>
        <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc1.3">
1.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;User Acceptance</H2>

<p>
Emacspeak introduced the innovative speech-enabling
approach to a target audience that had been entrenched
in the well-established (though inferior) technology of
screenreaders. Consequently, user acceptance of the
system upon its introduction in 1995 was initially
lukewarm. However, as more and more users try the
system and find it more productive, this initial
obstacle is being progressively eroded.  From an initial
handful of users in 1995, the system has had a steadily
growing user base.  Since 1997, Emacspeak has been
bundled with all popular distributions of the Linux
operating system; this has resulted in an exponential
rise in the user base.  With early adopters now
vociferously convincing other blind users about the
advantages inherent in the system, the Emacspeak user
community is now growing rapidly.  The group has its
own mailing list on the Internet and today offers
real-time support to new users as they find their way
around the system.

<p>

<H3>Originality</H3>

<p>

<OL type="1">
<li>  Developed because of the author's real need for
such a system, Emacspeak is replete with features that
have all been designed because of real user needs.

<p>

<li>  Distributed free of cost, the zero cost of ownership
significantly lowers the threshold of entry for
visually impaired users.

<p>

<li> The system has enabled the author and many others to
  compete effectively at the workplace in the high
  technology field.

<p>

<li>  The system opens up higher education to visually
impaired users, thereby significantly enhancing their
ability to obtain productive employment in the high
technology field.
</OL>
<p>
In summary, speech-enabling all user applications and
providing efficient aural communication via audio
formatted output are Emacspeak's key original features.
In 1995, Emacspeak was also the first system designed
for visually impaired users to be distributed free of
cost on the Internet.

<p>

<H3>Measure Of Success</H3>

<p>
The Emacspeak project has succeeded well beyond its
original goal of providing a usable eyes-free audio
desktop for the author's personal use. Today, Emacspeak
is widely used around the world by hundreds of blind
and visually impaired users to gain spoken access to
the Internet.  The system is being widely used within
several government agencies, notable amongst these the
National Security Agency (NSA), to provide spoken
access to computer workstations running the UNIX
operating system.  Additionally, Emacspeak has also
benefitted users with learning disabilities who find
that listening to information -in addition to seeing
it on the screen- enhances comprehension.

<p>
The success of the project is evinced by  the following
quotes from Emacspeak users:

<p>

<H3>A System Administrator At Vassar College Writes</H3>

<p>

<blockquote>Although I am sighted I have a reading impairment.  Prior to using Emacspeak
I relied on recorded audio tapes for my professional and personal reading,
and on screen readers for my computer interaction.

<p>
Since discovering Emacspeak, I have never gone back to
screen readers.  Emacspeak provides spoken feedback in a way
that is both aware of and responsive to applications and
their data.  As a result, I have been able to tailor my work
environment to provide spoken feedback that is
context-sensitive.  This means that I am now able to work
more efficiently and more enjoyably than ever before.

<p>
I have used Emacspeak to enable me to work on several NSF
projects, most notably the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES)
which is now used in the US and throughout Western, Central
and Eastern Europe.  I cannot imagine how I would have
accomplished this work without the access afforded me by the
Emacspeak interface.  For the last several years I have been
using Emacspeak not only in the conventional settings of
desktop computers and workstations at the office and at
home, but also as a full time digital assistant.  I have
found it an ideal output system for use in wearable
computing.  Using my current setup I am able to provide
system administration to over 100 users and several dozen
machines through the consistent interface that Emacspeak
provides.

<p>
Many newspapers and professional publications are now available on the
Internet.  Using the Emacspeak interface, I am for the first time able
to skim a newspaper or magazine, choose which articles I wish to read,
and read them at the same time as my coworkers and friends who may be
reading the same material from traditional sources.  This allows me to
discuss current literature with my peers in a timely fashion.  While
this may seem like a simple thing that most folks take for granted, it
was not possible for me in the past.  The time delay in getting
materials read onto audio cassette always meant that by the time I had
had the opportunity to read a journal, the rest of my peers had moved
on to the next issue.

<p>
Thanks to the information and access available to me through Emacspeak
I now have a greater degree of both social interaction and 
independence than in the past.  Put simply, Emacspeak
enables me to participate more fully in life.

<H3>An Employee At GE Says</H3>

<p>

<blockquote>    I feel that Emacspeak has exceeded its goals since it
    is a totally new and innovative approach to providing
    speech output to a blind computer user.  For example,
    using audio Icons in conjunction with spoken output
    gives the user the confidence that what he/she thinks
    should be taking place indeed really is.  I have been
    using Emacspeak on my job as a software engineer at
    GE-Harris, Railway Electronics for the last 10 months.
    I started using Emacspeak in 1995 when I started the
    Computer Science Undergraduate program at the
    University of Central Florida.  Thanks to Emacspeak, I
    work directly in the Unix environment.  I do all my
    programming using Emacspeak.
    
<p>
    In conclusion, I have benefited from the Emacspeak
    project both in obtaining my educational and
    professional goals.

<H3>A Recently Rehabilitated  Systems Administrator Says</H3>

<p>

<blockquote>  At first I found it extremely difficult learning to
    work within a sightless programming and admin environment.
    However, 12 months later and I can't imagine using any
    environment other than Emacspeak.  I am again working
    as a system administrator, developing software and
    currently organizing to return to my Phd. I don't think
    I would have been able to do all of this without Emacspeak.

<p>
    In conclusion, I would like to sincerely thank you for
    developing Emacspeak. I can honestly say that I doubt
    very much that I would have been able to return to
    either my development work or post graduate research if
    it had not been for Emacspeak.

<H3>A Student From Australia Says</H3>

<p>

<blockquote>    As a university student, I am undertaking graduate
    research in philosophy, whilst simultaneously studying
    law at an undergraduate level. To engage in these
    intellectual pursuits, I need access to electronic
    information, such as that which is available via the
    World Wide Web. Moreover, it is also necessary to
    prepare beautifully typeset documents, relying solely
    and speech output. The Emacspeak auditory
    interface uniquely supports and facilitates both of
    these activities, together with routine tasks such as
    file management and the manipulation of electronic
    mail.  Also, Emacspeak has enabled me to gain a greater
    understanding of computing in general and, more
    specifically, the advantages and drawbacks of different
    types of user interface. In conclusion, I would point
    out that it is Emacspeak which has enabled me to move
    beyond the limitations imposed by the DOS environment,
    and take advantage of some of the most capable and
    flexible software currently available (such as the
    Emacs editor, the <b>LaTeX</b> typesetting system and indeed
    the Linux environment itself).

1.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Background And Project Evolution</H2>

<p>
After using off-the-shelf commercial screenreaders
for about five years, I started developing
Emacspeak for my personal use in the fall of 1994.  The
decision to develop a new system was motivated by my
frustration with the quality of information access
provided by conventional screenreader technology.

<p>
Using my computer science background and experience
implementing <b>AsTeR</b> -Audio System For Technical
Readings-  I designed Emacspeak as a fully functional
audio desktop. <b>AsTeR</b> had pioneered the technique of
audio formatting for speaking structured documents;
Emacspeak took this invention one step further by
applying audio formatting to the entire computer
interface.

<p>
By early 1995, I had replaced the commercial
screenreader with Emacspeak for all my computing tasks;
after further testing, the system was made freely
available on the Internet.

<p>
I continue to extend and enhance Emacspeak based on
user needs; every six months, I make a stable release
of the system on the Internet.  Once released, the
system is mirrored world-wide by a network of software
archives.  Distributors of the freely available Linux
operating system then include the distribution on CDROM
for wider circulation.

<p>

<H3>Obstacles Faced</H3>

<p>
Lack of resources has been the primary obstacle. Emacspeak
is developed, maintained and supported entirely in the
author's spare time.  To extend the benefits of Emacspeak to
the larger community of non-technical users, the project
needs significant resources in order to provide the
requisite training materials and user education.

<p>
As described earlier, Emacspeak also faced the initial
hurdle of introducing a revolutionary solution to a
user community that was entrenched in using traditional
screenreaders for gaining non-visual access to
computing.  This obstacle has diminished with an
increasingly well-informed user base. However, there is
still considerable user education required in bringing
potential blind users and 
professionals working in the field of rehabilitation
up to speed with the innovations
introduced by Emacspeak.

<H1>Material For Time Capsule</H1>

<p>
Invented as an effective solution for providing eyes-free
information access to the visually impaired, Emacspeak is
poised to revolutionize the current state of the art in
mobile, automobile and hand-held computing.
The technological innovations introduced by Emacspeak 
could be deployed to profoundly impact 
how we interact with electronic information in our daily
lives.

<p>

<H2>Is Our Society Prepared For This Application?</H2>

<p>
Today's information age society is more than prepared for
this application.  The exponential rise in the amount of
information we process in our daily lives requires a
concomitant increase in the efficiency of the tools we use
to process the incoming information.  Whereas existing
interfaces insist on overloading the visual channel of
communication for processing <em>all</em> information,
speech-enabled interfaces as pioneered by Emacspeak help
individuals deal more effectively with the information
avalanche we all face.
Where technological innovations in information processing 
have progressively increased the ability of the computer to
   perform more and more information processing tasks in
   parallel,
the user-interface innovations introduced by Emacspeak help
balance the <em>human</em> side 
of the <em>human</em>-computer interface equation.

<p>

<H2>Is It Affordable?</H2>

<p>
Emacspeak is <em>completely</em> free of cost.
With personal computers continuously increasing in speed 
(and falling in price), 
technological innovations such as Emacspeak will become part
of the basic computing experience.

<p>

<H2>Was It Well-represented To The Public?</H2>

<p>
Emacspeak as a speech-enabled solution for visually impaired
users has been well-represented to the relevant user
community as demonstrated by the user feedback included in
the accompanying case study.  The technological innovations
have been represented to the scientific community in
numerous research publications that are also available
online. These  online resources 
have been discovered by the scientific
and popular press, resulting in a number of articles in
well-reputed magazines such as Scientific American that have
described the technology for the general public.  However,
making the average citizen aware of the potential benefits
of every-citizen interfaces remains an ongoing task.

<p>

<H2>Biographical Sketch</H2>

<p>
After receiving his PhD&nbsp;from Cornell University in 1994,
T.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Raman worked at Digital Equipment Corporation's
Cambridge Research Lab (CRL) until September&nbsp;1995.  He now
works at Adobe Systems, San Jose, Calif., on electronic
documents and information reuse.  He also continues to work
on speech interaction and recently published a book,
<i>Auditory User Interfaces: Toward the Speaking Computer</i>
(Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997).

<H2>Technical Background</H2>

<p>
My work on rich aural interfaces began with the work on
<b>AsTeR</b> (Audio System For Technical Readings) which is best
introduced by the following quote:

<blockquote>
<p>
The  advent of electronic documents makes  information  available in
more than  its visual form -electronic information can  now  be 
display independent.  
We  describe  a computing system, <b>AsTeR</b>, that
<em>audio formats</em>  electronic documents  to produce  
audio documents. 
</blockquote>
<p>
The development of <b>AsTeR</b>&nbsp;was the basis of my dissertation,
which was presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School of Cornell
University in fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor
of Philosophy in 1994.  This summary, written four years later, puts
the work in perspective with respect to the developments in the world
of electronic information and auditory interfaces between 1994 and
1998.  

<p>
<b>AsTeR</b> was motivated by the insight that information presentation
needs to take advantage of the specific perceptual modality in use.
This typeset manuscript exploits features of visual interaction to
convey information effectively; in the same vein, <b>AsTeR</b> introduced
the notion  of <em>audio formatting</em> to enable rich aural presentations
of structured information.

<p>

<H3>Speech-enabling Applications</H3>

<p>
The insights gained from developing and using <b>AsTeR</b> have
been applied to the more general problem of providing aural
access to computer interfaces, starting in late 1994.
Computer interfaces encapsulate man-machine dialogue, and
once we realize that ``The document <em>is</em> the
interface'', the technique of synthesizing effective aural
presentations starting with the information instead of its
visual presentation leads naturally to the speech-enabling
approach -see
the relevant online publications.

<p>
The speech-enabling approach -a technique that
separates computation from the user interface -is
described in detail in the book <i>Auditory User
  Interfaces: Toward the Speaking Computer</i>.  Application
designers can implement desired features in the
computational component and have different user interfaces
expose the resulting functionality in the manner most suited
to a given user environment.  This leads to the design of
high-quality Auditory User Interfaces (AUI) that integrate
speech as a first class citizen into the user interface.

<p>

<H3>Structured Information And The WWW</H3>

<p>
<b>AsTeR</b> pointed out the advantages to come in a world where
documents are created electronically before being turned
into modality specific presentations such as typeset
documents.  The work also pointed out the need for such
electronic information to be well-structured to enable
<em>computation</em> on this information.

<p>
The last few years have seen an explosive growth in
electronic information on the Internet fueled by the
popularity of the WWW.  The initial rush to the WWW
resulted in publishers putting out rich visual content with
a concomitant abuse of document structure as envisioned in
<b>AsTeR</b>.  As a consequence, content providers on the WWW
today face many of the challenges outlined in <b>AsTeR</b> when
attempting to create electronic content that can be
re-purposed for publishing online as well as in traditional
print formats.  This has also led to a vast amount of
Webformation that is becoming increasingly difficult to
navigate and categorize.  

<p>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<p>
As humans, we see, hear, feel and smell.  Human interaction
is enriched by the concomitant redundancy introduced by
multimodal communication.  In stark contrast, computer
interfaces until now have relied primarily on visual
interaction -today's interfaces are like the
<em>silent</em> movies of the past!  As we approach the turn
of the millennium, computers now have the ability to talk,
listen and perhaps, even <em>understand</em>.  Integrating new
modalities like speech into human-computer interaction
requires rethinking how information systems are designed in
today's world of <em>visual</em> computing.
  
<p>
  Visually rich computing introduced the notion of What You
  See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) documents; but by carrying
  it too far, we risk ending up in a world of ``What You See
  Is All You Have'' documents.  On the positive side, the
  exponential growth in electronic information combined with
  a desire to be able to intelligently process this content
  and access it whenever, wherever and however the user
  chooses provides adequately strong reasons to suggest that
  the world will move away from the present situation of
  <em>see-only</em> documents.
              
<p>
  That a blind person can navigate the Internet just as
  efficiently and effectively as any sighted person attests
  to the profound potential of digital documents to improve
  human communication. Printed documents are fixed snapshots
  of changing ideas; they limit the means of communication
  to the paper on which they are stored. But in electronic
  form, documents can become raw material for computers that
  can extract, catalogue and rearrange the ideas in them.
  Used properly, technology can separate the message from
  the medium so that we can access information wherever,
  whenever and in whatever form we want.
  
<p>
  Archiving information in a structurally rich form will
  ensure that this vast repository of knowledge can be
  reused, searched and displayed in ways that best suit
  individuals' needs and abilities, using software not yet
  invented or even imagined.  The coming millennium is likely
  to prove an exciting one in the world of electronic
  information and speech interaction.
