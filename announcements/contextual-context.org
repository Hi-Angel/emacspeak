* Executive Summary

  Context switching in an Emacs workflow comes down to switching
  buffers --- and consequently, Emacs provides a large number of
  built-ins and extensions packages for /switching buffers/. One can
  put together numerous workflows by picking among these to make
  context switching /contextual/ --- using the most appropriate
  workflow can lead to  being able to focus much better on the core
  task of creating, editing, reviewing and publishing all forms of
  content.

  This article summarizes my present workflow --- it's entirely
  keyboard driven and optimized for
  an eyes-free workflow.
  
* Where Does /Context/ Come From?

Context as used in this article can be traced back to the current task at
hand --- here are some illustrative examples:

  1. Editing a set of related files.
  2. Switching among a collection of chat buffers.
  3. Switching among a collection of mail folders.
  4. Switching among a collection of open Web pages.
  5. Switching among a /small/ number of recently used buffers.
