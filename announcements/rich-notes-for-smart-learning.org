* Background 

As a student, I learnt to take notes in Braille while in class and
while lerning from audio books.  Now, in the age of online computing,
a complete audio desktop in the form of Emacspeak, a wealth of online
resources in the form of E-Books, Audio Books, Podcasts and Blogs, all
accessible from a consistent environment, I've been asking myself what
/taking notes/ in this environment should look like, and this article
summarizes the present state of what I've implemented at present.
