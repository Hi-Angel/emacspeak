* Executive Summary 

Porting  Emacspeak sound environment to Pulseaudio.

Until now, emacspeak features that enhance the auditory display have
relied exclusively on ALSA and avoided Pulseaudio all together. As
Pulseaudio improves, and  simultaneously gets harder to get rid of, I
recently ported the required features to work under Pulseaudio, see
below for details.
* Summary Of Auditory Display Enhancements 

  - Notifications, e.g., /speaking the time/, /incoming IM messages/
  etc. are spoken on a separate notification stream.
  - The above normally plays on the right ear, but enhanced with a
    /binaural/ effect.
  - This can be configured to be on the left ear when running
    Emacspeak remotely on a cloud-top.
  - A /Bauer Stereo To Binaural/ [[https://www.google.com/search?num=25&lite=90586&q=bs2b+bauer+Stereo+To+Binaural][(BS2B)]]
    filter is applied to all
    output streams to provide an enhanced headphones listening experience.
  - The /outloud/ server has been updated to request  lower latency
    from Pulse; Pulseaudio defaults are too high for highly responsive
    TTS.

For details on Emacspeak's enhancement to the auditory display, see
prior articles listed in the /References/ section.

* Configuring Pulseaudio To Enhance The Auditory Display


All of these features have been available until now by installing a
custom ~.asoundrc~; these are now available under Pulseaudio by
installing a ~.config/pulse/default.pa~ in the user's home directory.

: cp EMACSPEAK_DIR/etc/pulse/default.pa ~/.config/pulse; pulseaudio -k

The above is a one-time operation that sets up the audio environment
