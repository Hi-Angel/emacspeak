* Summary

A collection of keybinding changes I have arrived at over time to
protect my fingers.Note that I have now used Emacs for more than 33
years, and some of these changes may well have helped me much earlier;
on the other hand, I likely didn't notice these issues because my
hands then were not the same as what they are now.
